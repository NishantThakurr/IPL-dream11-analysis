# IPL dream 11 analysis using Python

Analysis of past performances of every player of an IPL team when they played head on head with the players in the opponent team and trying to predict players which are most likely to perform.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm an engineer by academic qualification.I am a nerd for data and numbers and have a warm enthusiasm for converting raw data into powerful insights or useful machine learning and deep learning models.



## Roadmap

1)The simplest and hardest part of this project was to collect the data.I had to collect various IPL individual year data and merge them together.I had to do a lot of data manipulation and cleaning since names of players were different on different dataset.MS-Excel was really helpful here.

2)I took 2 phases of the game separately.The first phase was when a particular team(let's say team1) was batting and the second phase was when it was bowling.

3)I filtered out the deliveries where both the batsman was from team1 and bowler was from team2 and vice versa.

4)Then batting and bowling stats of each player from both the teams were extracted.

5)Stats of each player was analysed using bar plots

6)A list of players was generated with the most impressive stats.

## Improvements

1)Disclaimer-This analysis works only when there is a record of past performance.It will fail if most the players are not experience and are playing their first season.So for these players you can try to extract some domestic tournament records.Best of luck with that.
2)You can also extract some international game record.
3)You can also try to add analysis of performance of these players based on the condition of pitch,venue etc.
4)You can also analyse momentum of each player especially for the ones which have no records against the opponent team
